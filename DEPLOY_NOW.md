# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. ✅ **Training API endpoints added** - Full training simulation with progress bars, metrics, and logs
2. ✅ **Project cleaned** - Removed unnecessary files (PPT, PDFs, old scripts)
3. ✅ **Deployment config created** - `vercel.json` optimized for deployment
4. ✅ **Code committed** - All changes saved to Git
5. ⏳ **GitHub push in progress** - Large files being uploaded (may take 10-15 minutes)

## 🎯 Deploy to Vercel NOW (2 Methods)

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended - Easiest)

**Once GitHub push completes:**

1. Go to **https://vercel.com**
2. Click **"Sign in with GitHub"**
3. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
4. Find and select: **`omkarkalagi/Ai-Deepfake-Detector`**
5. Click **"Import"**
6. **Project Settings:**
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave default)
   - Build Command: (leave empty)
   - Output Directory: (leave empty)
   - Install Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Click **"Deploy"**
8. Wait 2-3 minutes ⏱️
9. **Done!** Your app will be live at: `https://ai-deepfake-detector.vercel.app`

### Method 2: Vercel CLI (For Advanced Users)

```powershell
# 1. Login to Vercel (opens browser)
vercel login

# 2. Deploy to production
cd C:\Projects\deepfake-detector
vercel --prod

# 3. Follow the prompts:
#    - Link to existing project? No
#    - Project name: ai-deepfake-detector
#    - Directory: ./ (press Enter)
#    - Override settings? No
```

## 🔍 Check GitHub Push Status

Run this command to check if push completed:

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\deepfake-detector
git fetch origin
git log origin/main --oneline -1
```

If you see: `Added training API endpoints, deployment config, and cleaned up project`
Then push is **COMPLETE** ✅

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these pages:

1. **Home Page** - Should load with hero section
2. **Training Page** - Click "Start Training":
   - ✅ Progress bars should move
   - ✅ Graphs should update
   - ✅ Logs should appear
   - ✅ Metrics should show (accuracy, loss, etc.)
3. **Statistics Page** - Should show charts
4. **About Page** - Should load
5. **Contact Page** - Should load
6. **Realtime Page** - Should load

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Training is simulated** on Vercel (demo mode) - this is intentional
- **Actual model training** would exceed Vercel's 60-second timeout
- **All other features** work normally
- **Large files** (models, datasets) are handled by Git LFS

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check build logs** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Common issues:**
   - Missing dependencies → Check `requirements.txt`
   - Memory limit → Already set to 3008MB (max)
   - Timeout → Already set to 60s (max)

### If training page doesn't work:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify API endpoints are responding:
   - `/api/start_training`
   - `/api/training_status`
