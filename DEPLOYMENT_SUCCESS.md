# 🎉 Deployment In Progress!

## ✅ What's Happening Now

### 1. Vercel Deployment (LIVE)
Your application is being deployed to Vercel!

**🔗 Deployment URLs:**
- **Inspect/Monitor**: https://vercel.com/omkar-ds-projects/deepfake-detector/5LxGBK8y9jnEvn5W8woM9ywUmWps
- **Production URL**: https://deepfake-detector-qzcrkl52y-omkar-ds-projects.vercel.app

**Status**: Building... (usually takes 2-5 minutes)

### 2. GitHub Push (IN PROGRESS)
Your code is being pushed to GitHub in the background.

**Repository**: https://github.com/omkarkalagi/Ai-Deepfake-Detector

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

Once the deployment completes (check the Inspect URL above), test these features:

### ✅ Pages to Test:
1. **Home Page** (`/`)
   - Should load with hero section and features

2. **Training Page** (`/training`) ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT**
   - Click "Start Training" button
   - ✅ Progress bars should animate
   - ✅ Epoch counter should increment
   - ✅ Graphs should update in real-time
   - ✅ Training logs should appear
   - ✅ Metrics should show (Accuracy, Loss, Precision, Recall)
   - ✅ "Stop Training" and "Pause Training" buttons should work

3. **Statistics Page** (`/statistics`)
   - Should show charts and metrics

4. **About Page** (`/about`)
   - Should load with project information

5. **Contact Page** (`/contact`)
   - Should load with contact form

6. **Realtime Page** (`/realtime`)
   - Should load with webcam detection interface

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Training API Endpoints Added:
- ✅ `/api/start_training` - Starts training simulation
- ✅ `/api/training_status` - Returns real-time progress
- ✅ `/api/stop_training` - Stops training
- ✅ `/api/download_model` - Downloads trained model

### Training Features:
- ✅ **Demo Mode**: Realistic training simulation (no actual model training)
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Epoch and batch progress bars
- ✅ **Live Metrics**: Accuracy, Loss, Precision, Recall
- ✅ **Animated Charts**: Real-time graph updates
- ✅ **Training Logs**: Timestamped log entries
- ✅ **Control Buttons**: Start, Stop, Pause functionality

### Configuration:
- ✅ **vercel.json**: Optimized for Hobby plan (1024MB memory, 60s timeout)
- ✅ **requirements.txt**: All dependencies specified
- ✅ **Git LFS**: Large files handled properly

## 📊 Deployment Configuration

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/static/(.*)",
      "destination": "/static/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/index"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "api/index.py": {
      "maxDuration": 60,
      "memory": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Settings:**
- **Memory**: 1024MB (Hobby plan limit: 2048MB)
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds (maximum for Hobby plan)
- **Runtime**: Python 3.9+ (automatic)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Go to the Inspect URL above
   - Click on "Building" or "Deployment" tab
   - Look for error messages

2. **Common Issues**:
   - **Memory Error**: Already optimized to 1024MB
   - **Timeout Error**: Training is simulated (fast)
   - **Module Not Found**: Check `requirements.txt`

### If Training Page Doesn't Work:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for `/api/start_training` request
   - Should return `200 OK` status
3. **Check Console for Errors**:
   - JavaScript errors will appear here

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know deployment succeeded when:

1. ✅ Vercel shows "Ready" status (green checkmark)
2. ✅ Production URL loads the home page
3. ✅ Training page shows the interface
4. ✅ Clicking "Start Training" shows progress bars moving
5. ✅ Graphs update in real-time
6. ✅ Logs appear with timestamps

## 📞 Next Steps

### After Deployment Succeeds:

1. **Test All Features** (see checklist above)
2. **Share Your App**:
   - Production URL: `https://deepfake-detector-qzcrkl52y-omkar-ds-projects.vercel.app`
   - Or set up custom domain in Vercel dashboard

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Analytics: Check usage and performance metrics

4. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add custom domain
   - Enable analytics
   - Set up environment variables (if needed)
